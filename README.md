# Deep learning basics

Deep learning basics with Python, TensorFlow and Keras provided by Harrison Kinsly aka sentdex on [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-deep-learning-python-tensorflow-keras/)

1. Initial library setup (tensorflow installation), loading MNIST dataset, visualizing the image of the digits with matplotlib, normalizing the data with keras.utils. Then, we specify a simple feedforward-backpropagation 3 layers neural network, train and evaluate it. Optional: we can save a model locally then reload it to make predictions on new examples
